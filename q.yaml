# Asynchronous Promises with Q

If a function cannot return a value or throw an exception without
blocking, it can return a promise instead.
A promise is an object that represents the return value or the thrown exception
that the function may eventually provide.

[The Q Promise Library](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) is the ground-breaking
promise library for JavaScript, based on the work of [Mark Miller][] and [Tyler
Close][] and built with substantial contributions from [Domenic Denicola][].

Often imitated, Q is still a solitary example of a promise library that
supports queueing messages to remote objects, using [Q-Connection][].

Version 1 is a stand-alone library that can be used without modification in
Node.js and browsers.
[Version 2][] is a work in progress that trims down the interface, breaks it
into smaller modules, and adds support for estimated time to completion.
At the heart of the new Q is the [ASAP][] task library.

Notably absent is support for [cancellation][], which in the process of writing
[A General Theory of Reactivity][GToR], I found to be incompatible with
promises, but conceivable with something similar, tentatively called Tasks.
With A General Theory, there is a prototype for this.

Version 2 of Q comes with a [Version 2 of Q-Connection][].
The new version has better semantics for methods of remote promises.
A method of a remote reference will always produce another remote reference,
and only by calling `pull()` will a remote object be serialized and transported
over the wire to a local copy.
Only by calling `push()` will a local object be serialized and transported over
the wirte to a remote copy.
It is possible to build remote object graphs, complete with cycles.

Version 2 of Q and Q-Connection should eventually introduce a `there` method,
which is like `then`, but accepts code to run where the value is local.

Eventually, [Dr. SES][] (Distributed Robust Secure ECMAScript) will make it
possible to safely run arbitrary code on behalf of mutually suspicious parties.
