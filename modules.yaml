# Modules, Packages, and Versions

Software should be made from small, coherent, loosely coupled, interchangeable
units with sovereignty over the names in their scope.
These laws apply equally well to every language, including extensible HTML in
whatever shape it comes.

Modules should be bundled in packages that declare their relationships to
versions of other packages.
The package should provide a level of indirection between modules and the
versions of their dependencies in other packages.

The package should provide the means to allow the producer to express whether a
version intends to be backward compatible and give consumers of that package
the ability to opt-in for backward incompatible versions.
The package should also provide a level of indirection between the identifiers
modules use to depend on external modules, and where those modules are
installed.
Within a cohort of packages, including their transitive dependencies, no two
modules should duplicate the same feature, but the more cohorts, the merrier.
