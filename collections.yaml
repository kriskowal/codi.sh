# Collections

<!--
There is a cafeteria of operators that collections should pick from to form
their interface.
The contract is intrinsic to the operator, not the collection.
A collection should implement every applicable operator.
Many of these operators have generic implementations that can be implemented in
terms of a small kernel from the whole body of operators.

Collections should also be observable.
Each collection supports the applicable change observer functions for
property changes (including length), splice-like changes (range changes), and
key value changes (map changes).
-->

Array was only the beginning.
The collections library provides lists, sets, and maps of various kinds.
These are available in npm with `npm install collections` and useful both in
browsers and Node.js.

See [collectionsjs.com](http://www.collectionsjs.com/) for thorough
documentation of [Collections, Version 1][].

[Collections, Version 1]: https://github.com/montagejs/collections

Version 1 is at the heart of [MontageJS][], providing extensions to the Array
and Object prototypes, as well as change listeners that are the foundation of
Montage MVC bindings with [FRB][].

[Collections, Version 2][] removes all of these shims in favor of polymorphic operators, each
packaged separately, including [pop-swap][] for high performance array
changes, and [pop-observe][] for change observers on most collections.
