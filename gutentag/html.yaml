### html.html

An HTML tag controls the HTML that appears at its position based on its `value`
property.
Like a text tag, the HTML tag does not introduce a wrapper element.
Note that `html` is a special tag in the HTML5 vocabulary, so this tag has to be
linked by an alternate tag name or used in XML.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/html.html" as="x-html">
    </head>
    <body>
        <x-html id="description"></x-html>
    </body>
</html>
```

```js
html.value = "<b>Bold <i>and</b> italic</b></i>";
```
