# Space

Unlike normal HTML, by default, white space is treated as insignificant.
All text nodes are trimmed and thrown away if they only contain spaces.
However, there is a built in ``<sp>`` tag that explicitly marks parts of the
document where white space is significant.
In these regions, sequences of space are preserved.
In the following example, the string "Guten Tag, Welt!" is repeated for every
value of the greetings iteration.
The ``<sp>`` tag ensures that these greetings are delimited by space.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="tag" href="../../repeat.html">
    </head>
    <body>
        <repeat id="greetings"><sp>Guten Tag, Welt! </sp></repeat>
    </body>
</html>
```
