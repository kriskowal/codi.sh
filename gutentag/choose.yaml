# choose.html

Reveals one of its options, as expressed by named child tags, based on its
`value`.
Constructs the children on demand.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="extends" href="./essay">
        <link rel="tag" href="../../choose.html">
        <link rel="tag" href="../../repeat.html">
        <link rel="tag" href="../../text.html">
    </head>
    <body>
        <repeat id="buttons">
            <button id="button">
                <text id="buttonLabel">â€”</text>
            </button>
        </repeat>
        <choose id="options">
            <a>Police</a>
            <b>Officer</b>
            <c>Wolves</c>
            <d>Old Witch</d>
            <e>Going to Sleep</e>
        </choose>
    </body>
</html>
```

```js
choose.value = "e";
```

A `<choose id="options">` tag instantiates one of its choices in a fresh scope
each time its value changes.
The name of that scope comes from the identifier of the component and the given
value, so the iteration would be called "options:e" in this case.
