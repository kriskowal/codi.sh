# Features of Guten Tags

Guten tags express their dependencies on other tags using links with the "tag"
relationship in their `<head>`.
In this examle, we import the `<repeat>` and `<text>` tags from Guten Tag
modules.

```html
<head>
    <link rel="extends" href="./list">
    <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/repeat.html">
    <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/text.html">
</head>
```

Guten tags have a lexical scope for component and element identifiers, and can
introduce components into caller scopes under the identifier of the caller.
In this example, there is a repetition with an id of "items" that introduces
"items:iteration" in the iteration scopes from the body of the repetition.

```html
<ul><repeat id="items">
    <li id="item" type="a"><text id="text"></text></li>
</repeat></ul>
```

Guten tag only provides the `<text>`, `<html>`, `<repeat>`, `<reveal>`, and
`<choose>` tags and the system for loading tags.
Bring your own bindings, shims, data, animation, or virtual document if you need
them.
The "Guten Tag, Welt!" application is about 15K and 3K after uglify and gzip.

A tag is defined in HTML or XML and can import tags from other HTML modules.
This `list.html` tag produces a list at whatever point in a document you
incorporate it.
An instance of a tag is a component.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="extends" href="./list">
        <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/repeat.html">
        <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/text.html">
    </head>
    <body>
        <ul><repeat id="items">
            <li id="item" type="a"><text id="text"></text></li>
        </repeat></ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

A JavaScript module, `list.js`, connects the components of the list.
The HTML module exports a constructor for the module and calls into the `add`
method of the underlying JavaScript implementation, if it exists.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = List;
function List() {}
List.prototype.add = function (child, id, scope) {
    if (id === "items:iteration") {
        scope.text.value = child.value;
    } else if (id === "this") {
        this.items = scope.items;
    }
};
```

Trivial tags can live without an underlying JavaScript implementation.

Tags modules compile to JavaScript that export a component constructor..
The constructor accepts a `body` and a `caller` scope.

```
"use strict";
module.exports = Component;
function Component(body, caller) {
    this.scope = caller.root.nestComponents();
    body.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Guten Tag, Welt!\n"));
}
```

The `body` is a special kind of node in a virtual document.
It represents a point in the actual document that the given tag will control.
Bodies can be added and removed from the virtual document, and all of their
content will be (synchronously) added or removed from the actual document.
However, bodies do not introduce a container element, like a `<div>`.
This is critical for the Gutenttag structural tags, `<repeat>`, `<reveal>`, and
`<choose>`, since you may or may not need a container element around them or
inside them, and you may want one or more of these inline.

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th><!-- corner --></th>
        <th id="groupOneHeader" colspan=""></th>
        <th id="groupTwoHeader" colspan=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><text id="rowHeader"></text></th>
        <repeat id="groupOne">
            <td><text id="cell"></text></td>
        </repeat>
        <repeat id="groupTwo">
            <td><text id="cell"></text></td>
        </repeat>
    </tr>
</table>
```

In other cases, having a wrapper element would interfere with CSS selectors,
particularly for the flex model, or would interfere with semantic markup.

```html
<repeat id="stanzas"><p class="stanza">
    <repeat id="lines">
        <text id="line"></text>
        <reveal id="medial"><br></reveal>
    </repeat>
</p></repeat>
```

Sometimes it is useful to compose text without container elements at all.

```html
<sp><text id="hello">, <text id="person">!</sp>
```

The `caller` object is a scope container that inherits properties along its
prototype chain up to the root scope.
This makes the root scope object an ideal container for dependency injection.
The `scope.root` refers to that root scope from any descendant scope.
Each scope also has a direct reference to its `scope.parent`.

In a component, `scope.this` will always refer to the component instantiated by
containing tag document.
So, in `foo.html`, `scope.this` is the containing instance of the `Foo`
component.
The `scope.components` object maps component identifiers in that scope to their
corresponding component instance.

Every subcomponent has a scope, but many scopes share the same
`scope.components`.
The body of an HTML tag is the root of a lexical scope and introduces an empty
`scope.components` object to which each child component adds itslef.
In this example, the `scope.components` object will have `hello` and `person`
components.
Note that Gutentags trim implied white space between tags and the `<sp>` special
tag notes explicit template text.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/text.html">
    </head>
    <body>
        <text id="hello"></text><sp>, </sp>
        <text id="person">!
    </body>
</html>
```

The Gutentag building blocks, `<repeat>`, `<reveal>`, and `<choose>` create
child scopes that introduce a new `scope.components` object that inherits
prototypically from the containing scope's components,
`scope.parent.components`.
In this example, the "hello" and "person" components are each within a
"greetings:iteration" component and have access to `scope.components.header`,
but from the perspective of the "header", it is in a scope by itself.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/text.html">
        <link rel="tag" href="gutentag/repeat.html">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1><text id="header"></h1>
        <repeat id="greetings">
            <text id="hello"></text><sp>, </sp>
            <text id="person">!
        </repeat>
    </body>
</html>
```

Each scope may also have a `scope.caller` property, referring to the lexical
scope of the tag that instantiated this component, and a `scope.argument`
referring to a template for the content of the instantiating tag.

Instantiating a tag from within a tag also passes its inner content as a
template in the form requested by that tag through its `<meta accepts>` header.
For example, `text.html` has `<meta accepts="[text]">`, `repeat.html` has `<meta
accepts="[body]">`, and `choose.html` has `<meta accepts="[entries]">`.
Each of these packs the content into `caller.argument` in the fashion expected
by the component.
