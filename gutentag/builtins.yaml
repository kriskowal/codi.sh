## Tags

The gutentags project provides the following building block tags, all of which
have very simple implementations that you can copy and modify for your needs.
They all have a mutable `value` property.

- `text.html` controls inline text
- `html.html` controls an inline block of HTML
- `repeat.html` repeats its argument
- `reveal.html` shows or hides its argument
- `choose.html` shows one of its argument tags

There is also a `<this>` tag for self recursion, and `<sp>` for explicit space
sensitivity.
