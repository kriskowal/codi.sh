# Operators and Polymorphism

Within a corhort of modules, any pair of functions with the same symbol or name
should fulfill a common contract, regardless of what type they operate on,
whether they are free standing functions that accept objects, or objects that
implement methods.

New operators should be able to extend the behavior of older types, and new
types should be able to extend older operators.

A well-planned system of objects is beautiful: a system where every meaningful
method for an object has been anticipated in the design.
Inevitably, another layer of architecture introduces a new concept and with it
the temptation to monkey-patch, dunk-punch, or otherwise cover-up the omission.
But reaching backward in time, up through the layers of architecture doesn't
always compose well, when different levels introduce concepts of the same name
but distinct behavior.

A polymorphic operator is a function that accepts as its first argument an
object and varies its behavior depending on its type.
Such an operator has the benefit of covering for the types from higher layers of
architecture, but defers to the eponymous method name of types yet to be
defined.
Such functions make it possible for a single interface to extend earlier layers
of architecture and be extended by later layers of architecture.
