# System

[System][] is a packaged module loader and bundler for browsers and Node.js.
For browsers, it supports refresh-to-reload debugging, as well as a build step
compatible with Browserify to produce bundles for production.

[System]: https://github.com/gutentags/system

To use, `npm install -S system` in your package.  Then use the boot script to
load your entry module.

```html
<script
    src="node_modules/system/boot.js"
    data-import="./entry">
</script>
```

System loads CommonJS modules and JSON by default, just like Node.js and
Browserify, including support for `index.js` files.
In addition, each package can translate modules from other languages to
JavaScript, on-the-fly in the browser during development, and during a build
step in Node.js for production.

Translators are configured per-package in `package.json`.

```json
{
  "translators": {
    "text": "./translate-text"
  }
}
```

A translator module must export a function that modifies a module object,
specifically its `text` property and `dependencies` array.

```js
"use strict";
module.exports = function translateText(module) {
    module.text = "module.exports = " +
        JSON.stringify(module.text);
};
```

Use the enclosed `bundle` script to create a `bundle.js` from your
`entry.js` module for deployment.
Translator modules need to run both in the browser and in Node.js for this to
work properly.

```
$ bundle entry.js > bundle.js
```

The Module System opens the door for many opportunities including HTML modules
with [Guten Tag][].
